# ToroHealth Damage Indicators

With ToroHealth Damage Indicators, damage given, received, or mitigated will be displayed as a number that pops off of the entity.

Also, health bars will appear in the top left corner for the entity in the player's crosshairs.

Customization options are available for changing the color of the damage numbers and the display style of the health bar (Compact or Standard).  I will soon be adding options to re-position the health bars and may make some visual tweaks to them.
